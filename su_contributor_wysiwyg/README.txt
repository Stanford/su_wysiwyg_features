SU WYSIWYG CONTRIBUTOR FEATURE
==============================
ver. 6.x-1.0-alpha5

Because we cannot select which wysiwyg filters are imported, we get them all.

In this case, the image_resize_filter is introduced, which may impede our ability to properly segment image and text Features. We'll see.
